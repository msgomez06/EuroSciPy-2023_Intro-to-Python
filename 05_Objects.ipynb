    "# Objects and Classes\n",

    "In the previous notebook, we looked at how functions are definde in Python and how they can be used to create reusable code. In this notebook, we'll look at another way to create reusable code in Python: classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider variables a way of storing data digitally, and functions as ways of defining tasks for the computer to perform, then objects are a way of organizing both data and tasks together. Objects are a way of organizing data and functions _together_ into a single entity. This is called **encapsulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Describe the role of objects in Python\n",
    "2. Define methods and attributes\n",
    "3. Read code that defines a class\n",
    "4. Create objects from a class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object can have any number of variables associated with it (called **attributes**), and any number of functions associated with it (called **methods**). The attributes and methods of an object are accessed using the `.` operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a look to the previous notebooks with this in mind, you might realize that *you've been using objects all along*. For example, when you create a list, you're creating an object. The list has attributes (e.g., the data it contains, its type, and others) and methods (e.g., append, sort, and others)."
