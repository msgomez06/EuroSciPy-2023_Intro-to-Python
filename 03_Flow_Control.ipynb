    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements take the form of logical expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False` (thinking back on variable types, they evaluate to Boolean value). The simplest conditional statement is an `if` statement. The `if` statement evaluates a logical expression and executes a block of code if the expression evaluates to `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "In Python, we can use the `if` keyword to start a conditional statement, and follow it with the expression to be evaluated, and a colon (`:`) to indicate the start of a block of code. The rest of the line can contain the code to be run (if it is short enough), or the code can be placed on the next line, indented by a tab or four spaces. The code block ends when the indentation ends. "

    "### Extra Information on Conditional Statements - Structural Pattern Matching\n",
    "Python 3.10 and higher has a new feature called structural pattern matching. It is a generalization of the `switch` statement found in other languages. It is a powerful tool for writing code that is easy to read and maintain.\n",

    "        <action>\n",
    "    case <pattern> if <condition>:\n",
    "        <action>\n",
    "    case <pattern> | <pattern>:\n",
    "        <action>\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        <action>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<expression>` is evaluated and then compared to each `<pattern>` in order. If a match is found, the corresponding `<action>` is executed. If no match is found, a `MatchError` is raised. The `case _:` is a catch-all pattern that matches anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed the notebook using Python 3.9, so we won't provide examples that use structural pattern matching. However, we encourage you to explore this feature on your own time - it's a great way to make your code more readable and maintainable!"
