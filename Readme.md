# Welcome to the EuroSciPy 2023 Intro to Python Tutorial Repository

If this is your first time trying to use Python, we recommend opening the guide to running Python, which [you can find by clicking here](https://github.com/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/00_Running_Python_Scripts.md).

For the EuroSciPy 2023 session, we will be using Colab to run the notebooks - though you're free to use Binder (or a local installation of Python) if you prefer. If you're using Colab, you can open the notebooks by clicking on the links below:

* [01_Base_Var_Types_and_Operators.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/01_Base_Var_Types_and_Operators.ipynb)
* [02_Container_Types.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/02_Container_Types.ipynb)
* [03_Flow_Control.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/03_Flow_Control.ipynb)
* [04_Functions_and_Libraries.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/04_Functions_and_Libraries.ipynb)
* [05_Objects.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/msgomez06/EuroSciPy-2023_Intro-to-Python/blob/main/05_Objects.ipynb)

If you're planning to use Binder, you can click the badge at the top of this page to launch the notebooks. If you're using a local installation of Python, you can clone this repository and run the notebooks locally.

If you finished the tutorials and want something more challenging to work on in the meantime, we have a couple of notebooks on Machine Learning that you might find interesting:  
[Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences Labs](https://github.com/tbeucler/2022_ML_EES/tree/main/Labs)  
These notebooks are part of a Masters' level course given at UNIL. They're meant for students with a background in Earth and Environmental Sciences and limited experience with Python. The notebooks are meant to be run on Colab, but you can also run them locally if you have a local installation of Python.

Thanks for your attention, best of luck with the other tutorials, and we hope you enjoy the rest of the conference!
